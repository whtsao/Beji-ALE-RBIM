# Beji-ALE-RBIM

The ALE-RBIM with RK4 is used for solving 2D potential flows.  
The RBIM can 1) enhance the efficiency and save computational cost, and 2) ensure the continuity of the high-order derivatives.  
The ALE approach avoids 1) distorted element; and 2) overshoot wave amplitude.  
The RK4 method improves the numerical stability.  
Wave dampen by absorption zone in the downstream.
